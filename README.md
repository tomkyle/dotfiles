##Integrate with your system

###.bash_aliases
This file contains some common shortcuts. You will want to have your own aliases; simply put them in a `~/.bash_aliases.local`, they will be included automatically by both `.bashrc` and `.zshrc`.

###.gitconfig
Many people use `.gitconfig` for storing their username or email or credentials cache lifetime â€“ nothing a config file to bother with. Instead, store them in a `.gitconfig.local`, it will be included automatically.

### .gitignore_global
List of rules for ignoring files in every Git repository on your computer.
See the article [https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) on GitHub Help.

###.paths
This essentially adds `~/bin` and `~/.composer/vendor/bin` to the `$PATH` variable, if they exist. Both `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` will include this file ; if you like to add more paths locally, store them in a file `~/.paths.local` which will then be included as well.

###.zshrc
This essentially is the default `.zshrc` from [Oh My ZSH!](http://ohmyz.sh/). It additionally includes the `.paths` and `.bash_aliases` to make them available both in bash and zsh.
